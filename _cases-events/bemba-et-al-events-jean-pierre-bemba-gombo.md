Pre-Trial Chamber II issued a sealed arrest warrant for Bemba on November 20, 2013, which was unsealed on November 28, 2013. Charges were confirmed against him on November 11, 2014. His trial [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr1155.aspx) on September 29, 2015.<br><br>Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was [found guilty](https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/Bemba-et-al_Article_70_Judgment_Summary_ENG.pdf) on all three charges under Article 70 and was [sentenced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1287) to one year imprisonment and a fine of EUR 300,000. On [appeal](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1362), Mr. Bemba’s conviction was upheld in part but he was acquitted of the charge of presenting false or forged evidence under Article 70(1)(b), with the Appeals Chamber finding that provision of the statute only applied to presenting documentary evidence, not calling of witnesses (at issues in this case). The case was remanded for reconsideration of the sentence in light of the Trial Chamber’s failure to adequately assess the gravity of the offenses.

Mr. Bemba was [re-sentenced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1407) on September 17, 2018, to one year imprisonment – with credit for prior detention, meaning the sentence&nbsp; was deemed served – and a EUR 300,000 fine. The Appeals Chamber [confirmed the re-sentencing](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=PR1500) decision, finding that the Trial Chamber acted within its discretion, did not err in law or fact, did not impose a disproportionate sentence, and did not violate Mr. Bemba’s rights.

After being acquitted in the main case ([Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/)), Mr. Bemba was [released](https://www.ijmonitor.org/2018/06/bemba-in-belgium-after-release-from-icc-detention/) from ICC custody in 2018.
