### Factual Allegations

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman was a senior leader in the Wadi Salih Locality in western Darfur, Republic of Sudan, and a member of the Popular Defense Forces (PDF).

The OTP alleges that Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman commanded thousands of militia/Janjaweed from August 2003 to March 2004, and that Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman was perceived as a mediator between the militia/Janjaweed and the Sudanese Armed Forces. While in these positions, Kushayb Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman allegedly recruited, armed, and funded the Janjaweed and the militias aligned with the Government of the Republic of Sudan. In so doing, Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman allegedly contributed to the implementation of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the militia/Janjaweed’s plan to maintain security in Darfur by attacking civilian populations perceived to be associated with rebels.

In 2003 and 2004, the Sudanese Armed Forces, the militias, and the Janjaweed allegedly carried out attacks against civilians in towns including Kodoom, Bindisi, Mukjar, Arawala and surrounding areas, which the OTP alleges were devoid of insurgency activities at the time.

Attacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces, militias, and Janjaweed often allegedly targeted civilians from the Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit populations, and included murder, rape and sexual violence, pillaging, and destruction of civilian property. Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman allegedly personally participated in some of these attacks.

In June 2020, Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman [surrendered himself voluntarily](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/06/1065992) in Central African Republic and was [transferred to ICC custody](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=PR1525).
