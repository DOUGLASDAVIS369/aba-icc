Pre-Trial Chamber II issued a sealed arrest warrant for Aimé Kilolo Musamba on November 20, 2013, which was unsealed on November 28, 2013. Mr. Kilolo entered ICC custody on November 25, 2013. Charges were confirmed against Mr. Kilolo on November 11, 2014. His trial [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1155) on September 29, 2015.<br><br>Aimé Kilolo Musamba was [found guilty](https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/Bemba-et-al_Article_70_Judgment_Summary_ENG.pdf) of corruptly influencing witnesses, presenting false evidence, and aiding witnesses in providing false testimony, and was subsequently [sentenced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1287) to pay a fine of EUR 30,000 and to a suspended sentence of 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with approximately 11 months deducted for time already imprisoned. On appeal, Mr. Kilolo’s conviction was [upheld in part](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1362) but he was acquitted of the charge under Article 70(1)(b) of presenting false or forged evidence. The case was remanded, per the OTP’s appeal, for reconsideration of the sentence upon findings that the Trial Chamber had erred in assessing the gravity of the offenses and does not have the power to impose suspended sentences.

On September 17, 2018, Mr. Kilolo was [re-sentenced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1407) to 11 months’ imprisonment – which was considered to have been served when accounting for prior imprisonment – and a fine of EUR 30,000.
