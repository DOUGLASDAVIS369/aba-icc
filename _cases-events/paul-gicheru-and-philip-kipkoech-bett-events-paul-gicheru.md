Mr. Gicheru [surrendered](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1540) to the authorities in The Netherlands on November 2, 2020 and was transferred into ICC custody shortly after. Mr. Gicheru made his [first appearance](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1545) on November 6, 2020. Pre-Trial Chamber A later [granted](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1563)Mr. Gicheru interim release in Kenya with conditions. The Court&nbsp;[severed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1552)&nbsp;the case between Paul Gicheru and Philip Kipkoech Bett on December 11, 2020, as Mr. Bett [remains at-large](https://www.icc-cpi.int/kenya/bett).

Pre-Trial Chamber A (Article 70) [confirmed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=PR1604)the charges against Mr. Gicheru on July 15, 2021 (a decision that cannot be appealed in Article 70 cases) after a written confirmation of charges procedure. The Chamber “[found](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2021_06271.PDF) substantial grounds that Mr. Gicheru committed, as a co-perpetrator, or under alternative modes of liability, offences against the administration of justice (article 70(1)(c) of the Rome Statute) between April 2013 and the closure of the Ruto and Sang case on 10 September 2015, in Kenya.” This determination allows the case to proceed to trial. &nbsp;

The opening of the trial against Mr. Gicheru is scheduled for February 15, 2022.
