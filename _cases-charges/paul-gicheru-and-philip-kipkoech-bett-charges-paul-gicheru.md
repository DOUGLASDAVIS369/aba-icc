### Factual Allegations

Paul Gicheru is suspected of offenses against the administration of justice, including allegedly corruptly influencing Prosecution witnesses through bribes and intimidation, in Kenya between April 2013 and September 2015 (the closure of the&nbsp;[Ruto and Sang case](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-ruto-and-sang/)). The OTP alleges that Paul Gicheru participated in a criminal scheme designed to systematically approach and corruptly influence witnesses of the OTP through bribery and other methods of inducements in exchange for their withdrawal as prosecution witnesses and/or recantation of their prior statements to the OTP.

The OTP alleges that this scheme has been run in an organized manner and with a clear distribution of tasks, and that Paul Gicheru has managed and coordinated the scheme, meaning that he has finalized agreements with corrupted witnesses, organized the formalization of their withdrawal and handled payments.
