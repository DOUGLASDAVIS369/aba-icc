On&nbsp;[appeal](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1362){: target="_blank"}, Mr. Kilolo’s conviction was upheld in part, but he was acquitted of the charge of presenting false or forged evidence under Article 70(1)(b). The Appeals Chamber found that provision of the statute only applied to presenting documentary evidence, not calling of witnesses (at issue in this case).

The Appeals Chamber also found that the Trial Chamber did not have the power to impose suspended sentences, as it had done in Mr. Kilolo's case, and that the Trial Chamber had failed to adequately assess the gravity of the offenses, and remanded to the Trial Chamber to determine a new sentence for Mr. Kilolo and two other defendants in the case.
