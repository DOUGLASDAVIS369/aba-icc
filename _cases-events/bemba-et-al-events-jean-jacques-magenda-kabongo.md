Pre-Trial Chamber II issued a sealed arrest warrant for Jean-Jacques Mangenda Kabongo on November 20, 2013, which was unsealed on November 28, 2013. Mr. Mangenda entered ICC custody on December 4, 2013. Charges were confirmed against Mr. Mangenda on November 11, 2014. His trial [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr1155.aspx) on September 29, 2015.

Jean-Jacques Mangenda Kabongo was [found guilty](https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/Bemba-et-al_Article_70_Judgment_Summary_ENG.pdf) of aiding witnesses in providing false testimony, presenting false or forged evidence, and corruptly influencing witnesses. Mr. Mangenda was acquitted of aiding witnesses in providing false testimony as to some witnesses. He was [sentenced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1287) to a suspended sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment with approximately 11 months deducted for prior detention.

On appeal, Mr. Mangenda’s conviction was [upheld in part](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1362) but he was acquitted of the charge under Article 70(1)(b) of presenting false or forged evidence, as the Appeals Chamber found that provision of the statute only applied to presenting documentary evidence, not calling of witnesses (at issue in this case). The case was remanded, per the OTP’s appeal, for reconsideration of the sentence upon the Appeals Chamber finding that the Trial Chamber had erred in assessing the gravity of the offenses and that the Trial Chamber does not have the power to impose suspended sentences. Mr. Mangenda was [re-sentenced](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1407) on September 17, 2018, to 11 months’ imprisonment, which was deemed to have been served in consideration of Mr. Mangenda’s prior detention.
