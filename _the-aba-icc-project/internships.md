The American Bar Association's (ABA) International Criminal Court (ICC) Project offers internships throughout the year to qualified individuals from anywhere in the world who have demonstrated an interest in the promotion of international criminal justice. Interns with the ICC Project undertake a wide variety of different work assignments, such as helping organizing advocacy events in Washington, D.C. and around the world, conducting research for material to be published on our websites, drafting memoranda on interesting issues in international criminal justice, and helping maintain work relationships with outside organizations and entities. In addition to working on the ICC Project, interns are offered the opportunity to assist other programs within the [ABA Criminal Justice Section](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/).

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, internships are currently conducted remotely within the United States. Unfortunately, we are not currently able to accommodate interns working remotely from a non-US location. Internships are unpaid, and can be completed for credit in accordance with relevant academic programs. There is a strong preference for applicants currently in law school with an understanding of international law; however, undergraduate applicants with background in international law and demonstrated capacity to work on typical ICC Project activities may be considered.&nbsp;*The ABA commits itself to building a multifaceted and diverse workforce, and thus strongly encourages applicants of any gender, sexual orientation, ethnic, religious, or other self-identified background.*

If interested in applying for an internship at the ICC Project, please email the following PDF formatted material (as a whole or in individual pieces) to the Director of the ICC Project, [Kristin Smith](/staff/kristin-smith/)\:

**For spring 2021 internships (Jan-May) please apply by Nov 1, 2021 at the latest. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis. Spring internships may be conducted remotely (TBD).<br><br>Applications for summer 2021 internships (June-Aug.) are welcome on a rolling basis.**
