**Background**&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Preliminary Examination of the Situation in Iraq focuses on alleged atrocity crimes committed during an armed conflict which involved international forces (Multinational Force-Iraq (MNF-I), U.S. forces, UK forces), Iraqi government forces, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Islamic Army in Iraq, and other armed anti-government groups. The armed conflict occurred from March 2003 to July 2009.

In conjunction with its War on Terror and its war against Afghanistan, the U.S. considered a war against Iraq and claimed that the Saddam Hussein-headed government of Iraq had close ties to Al Qaeda, possessed weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological), and sought nuclear weapons. In March 2003, a U.S. and UK-led coalition of forces invaded Iraq. In April 2003, the Saddam Hussein-headed government was ousted. In May 2003, the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority assisted in the formation of the Iraqi Governing Council. In June 2004, the Iraqi Governing Council transferred governmental authority to the Iraqi Interim Government. In the course of the conflict, from 2003 to 2009, civilians were killed and injured by international forces, Iraqi government forces, and various armed anti-government groups.&nbsp;

**ICC Status**&nbsp;&nbsp;

Iraq is not a State Party to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and has not submitted a declaration under Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute accepting ICC exercise of jurisdiction over Iraq. However, the ICC may exercise jurisdiction over a State Partyâ€™s nationals who commit atrocity crimes on the territory of a non-State Party under Article 12(2)(b) of the Rome Statute. On February 2006, after receiving communications of alleged atrocity crimes committed in Iraq and conducting a preliminary examination, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) [closed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/04D143C8-19FB-466C-AB77-4CDB2FDEBEF7/143682/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf) the preliminary examination. On May 13, 2014, after receiving new communications of alleged atrocity crimes committed by UK nationals on the territory of Iraq, the OTP [reopened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-statement-iraq-13-05-2014) the preliminary examination.

In its 2017 report on preliminary examinations, the OTP said it had found a reasonable basis to believe that members of UK armed forces committed war crimes (willful killing/murder, torture and inhuman/cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape or other forms of sexual violence) against Iraqi persons in their custody. The OTP then assessed admissibility (complementarity and gravity), including the genuineness of domestic proceedings in the UK (the willingness of UK authorities to genuinely investigate and prosecute abuses), in light of allegations of attempts to shield perpetrators from liability.

On December 9, 2020, the Prosecutor [decided](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=201209-otp-statement-iraq-uk) to close the preliminary examination in Iraq/UK without opening an investigation. After assessing the various domestic investigations and processes conducted by the UK in a [detailed report](https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/201209-otp-final-report-iraq-uk-eng.pdf), the Prosecutor determined that despite concerns expressed in the report regarding certain processes, the OTP could not conclude that the UK has been unwilling genuinely to investigate or prosecute, or that decisions not to prosecute resulted from that unwillingness. Specifically, the OTP:

*\[could\] not conclude that the relevant investigative inquiries or investigative/prosecutorial decisions were made for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court; that there has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice; or that the proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.* (para. 502)
