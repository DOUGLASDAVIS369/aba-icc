Pre-Trial Chamber II issued a sealed arrest warrant for Fid&egrave;le Babala Wandu on November 20, 2013, which was unsealed on November 28, 2013. Mr. Babala entered ICC custody on November 25, 2013. Charges against Mr. Babala were confirmed on November 11, 2014. His trial [opened](https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr1155.aspx) on September 29, 2015.

On October 19, 2016, Mr. Babala was [convicted](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1245) of aiding Mr. Bemba, Kilolo and Mangenda in corruptly influencing 2 witnesses (Article 70(1)(c)). He was acquitted of aiding, abetting or otherwise assisting in corruptly influencing the 12 other witnesses, and acquitted of aiding, abetting, or otherwise assisting in giving false testimony by witnesses or presenting&nbsp; false evidence by any of the 14 witnesses to the court (Article 70(1)(a) and (b)). Mr. Babala was sentenced in total to 6 months’ imprisonment, with time spent previously in detention was deducted, which the Chamber therefore considered served.

On March 8, 2018, the Appeals Chamber&nbsp;[rejected](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1362){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;Mr. Babala’s appeals as to both his conviction and his sentence, making both final.
