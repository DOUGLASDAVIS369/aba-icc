Pre-Trial Chamber I issued a public [arrest warrant](http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc279813.pdf) for Ali Kushayb on April 27, 2007, which was followed by a second arrest warrant [made public in June, 2020](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2020_02363.PDF)

The initial appearance was on June 15, 2020, during which Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman’s case was severed from Mr. Harun’s (still at large) case.

The confirmation of charges hearing was from May 24 – 26, 2021. The purpose of the confirmation is for the judges to establish if there is sufficient evidence for the case to continue to a full trial. The charges can be confirmed either in full or in part.

Pre-Trial Chamber II [confirmed](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2021_06131.PDF) all 31 charges against Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman on July 9, 2021. Mr. Abd-Al-Rahman can only request to appeal the confirmation of these charges with the Pre-Trial Chamber II’s approval.

The Trial Chamber I [scheduled](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1806) the opening of the trial for April 5, 2022.
